*
**** SEISMIC VELOCITY MODEL RELATED PARAMETERS (TRAVEL-TIME 
*    TABLE):
*

*
* GLOBAL MODEL: Type of the reference spherical velocity model
* used to calculate all travel-time related theoretical data. 
* This package contains the following models:

*   ak135_A      AK135 model (Kennett et al., 1995)
*   iasp91_A     IASP91 model (Kennett, 1991; Kennett & 
*                Engdahl, 1991)
*   iasp91a_A    IASP91, with a corrected core model
*   jb_A         Jeffreys-Bullen model (Jeffreys & Bullen, 
*                1940 and later)
*   prem_A       PREM model (Dziewonski & Anderson, 1981)
*   sp6_A        SP6 model (Morelli & Dziewonski, 1993)
*
* Some additional, regional spherical Earth models with 
* different crusts and uppermost mantle layers were also 
* implemented in the HYPOSAT software package:
*
*   barey_A      BAREY, regional model for the European Arctic
*                (Schweitzer & Kennett, 2007)
*   barez_A      BAREZ, regional model for the European Arctic
*                (Schweitzer & Kennett, 2007)
*   barents16_A  BARENTS16, regional model for the western 
*                Barents Sea (Pirli & Schweitzer, 2017)
*   bergen_A     University of Bergen's velocity model for 
*                Norway (Havskov & Bungum, 1987)
*   fescan_A     NORSAR's Fennoscandia model (Mykkeltveit & 
*                Ringdal, 1981)
*
* The directory, where these travel-time tables reside, must 
* be specified with HYPOSAT_DATA before the program can start. 
* The travel-time tables are based on the libtau-software 
* package (Buland & Chapman, 1983), and distributed as 
* IASP91-software.
*
* All global travel-time models using the libtau-software were
* recalculated for the HYPOSAT package, stored in ASCII format 
* and got the suffix '_A' in their table names.
*
* The default global model is 'ak135_A'
*
GLOBAL MODEL                       : ak135_A

*
* Alternative spherical Earth models can be used for specific 
* paths:
*
* GLOBAL MODEL 2: Here one can give the name of any other
* second global model to be used for specific ray paths as 
* indicated in the data input file hyposat-in.
*
GLOBAL MODEL 2                     : ak135_A

*
* GLOBAL MODEL 3: Here one can give the name of any other 
* third global model to be used for specific ray paths as 
* indicated in the data input file.
*
GLOBAL MODEL 3                     : ak135_A

*
* GLOBAL MODEL 4: Here one can give the name of any other 
* fourth global model to be used for specific ray paths as 
* indicated in the data input file.
*
GLOBAL MODEL 4                     : ak135_A

*
* That HYPOSAT can apply crustal corrections, the seismic 
* velocities in the crust must be known for the chosen 
* dominant global model (set with GLOBAL MODEL). The crustal 
* structures of all libtau-type models are collected in a file 
* called std_crusts.dat and marked with a unique code. This 
* file must reside in the same directory as defined by 
* HYPOSAT_DATA. std_crusts.dat is included in the directory 
* data/. The different codes are:
*
*   E1      Jeffreys-Bullen (global standard model)
*   E2      PREM    (global standard model)
*   E3      IASP91  (global standard model)
*   E4      IASP91a (global standard model, with corrected 
*                    core)
*   E5      SP6     (global standard model)
*   E6      AK135   (global standard model)
*   E7      FESCAN  (regional standard model)
*   E8      BAREY   (regional standard model)
*   E8      BAREZ   (regional standard model)
*   EA      BARENTS16 (regional standard model)
*   EB      BERGEN  (regional standard model)
*   The default value is 'E6' (for AK135)
*
GLOBAL CRUSTAL MODEL CODE          : E6

*
* In the case of an ISF-formatted input file, no alternative 
* spherical Earth models can be defined. Instead, an 
* epicentral distance in [deg] can be defined, from which 
* distance on GLOBAL MODEL 2 should be used. As epicentral 
* distance the value from the ISF-formatted input file is 
* used.
*
* The default value is '999.' = no 2nd model usage with ISF 
* input.
*
ISF_2ND MODEL DISTANCE             : 999.

*
* HYPOSAT can combine global velocity models with an 
* epicentral distance dependent LOCAL OR REGIONAL MODEL. 
* Travel times will be calculated for the following seismic 
* phases (as far as they can be observed with respect to 
* distance and source depth): Pg, Pb, Pn, P, pPg, pPb, pPn, 
* pP, PbP (i.e., in this program the upper side reflection 
* from the 'Conrad'), PmP, PgPg, PbPb, PnPn, PP, and the 
* converted phases sPg, sPb, sPn, sP, SbP and SmP. The same 
* set of phases is also calculated for S-type phases, 
* respectively.
*
* If the file is not in the run-directory or the directory 
* defined by HYPOSAT_DATA, one must give the full file name 
* including its path.
*
* Set to '_' if no local model is used.
*
LOCAL OR REGIONAL MODEL            : _

* Local/regional travel-time models are either used around the
* source and/or to calculate travel-time corrections for 
* reflection points of phases at the Earth's surface or for 
* crustal differences between the dominant global model and 
* the actual structure at the stations (velocities & 
* elevation). The input is the name of the file containing the 
* model parameters. The velocity model must contain the 
* following information:
*
* In the first line maxdis = maximum distance in [deg] for 
* which this model shall be used. It is followed by lines with 
* depth in [km], the P-phase velocity Vp in [km/s], and the S-
* phase velocity Vs in [km/s]. The model may contain layers 
* with a constant velocity or with velocity gradients. First 
* order discontinuities must be specified with two lines for 
* the same depth. Additionally, the Conrad- and the 
* Mohorovi'i'-discontinuities must be marked as shown in the 
* following example. Otherwise, all calculated phases would be 
* called Pg (or Sg, respectively). The maximum number of 
* layers is set to 100.
*
* See file ../examples/loc.dat
*
*
* When using the local/regional model for calculating 
* local/regional travel-time tables and their partial 
* derivatives, one can define the seismic phase types to be 
* considered by a 4-digit number code: The position of a digit 
* defines the phase type for which the value of the digit 
* defines the action for this phase:
*
*   dxxx    the digit (d) at this place is the flag for 
*           surface reflections (e.g., pP or sS)
*   xdxx    the digit (d) at this place is the flag for 
*           surface multiples (e.g., PP or SS)
*   xxdx    the digit (d) at this place is the flag for 
*           reflections at the Conrad- or the Mohorovi'i'-
*           discontinuity (e.g., PbP or SmS). Note that here 
*           the name 'PbP' is used to indicate reflection 
*           from the Conrad discontinuity, is not a regular 
*           phase name as recommended by IASPEI (e.g., 
*           NMSOP-2, IS 2.1).
*   xxxd    the digit (d) at this place is the flag for 
*           converted phases (e.g., sP or PmS)
*    d      itself can have the following values:
*    d = 1  only P-type onsets will be calculated
*    d = 2  only S-type onsets will be calculated
*    d = 3  both phase types (P and S) will be calculated 
* e.g., 1320 means: 
*           the phases pP, PP, SS, SbS and SmS will be 
*           calculated, but no conversions. 
*   0000 or simply 0 means: 
*           only the direct P- and/or S-onsets, but none of 
*           the reflected and/or converted phases will be
*           calculated.
*
* The default value is set to '3333' and for any value below 
* 0, the program will ignore the local/regional model set by
* LOCAL OR REGIONAL MODEL.
*
PHASE INDEX FOR LOCAL MODEL        : 3333

*
* The following settings are steering the usage of the 1x1 
* degree crustal model CRUST 1.0 of Laske et al. (2013) 
* together with the other local/regional velocity models.
*
* <= 0       no usage of CRUST 1.0 or LOCAL OR REGIONAL MODEL
*            (default)
*  = 1       only the local/regional model is used as defined 
*            in LOCAL OR REGIONAL MODEL.
*  = 2       CRUST 1.0 only used for calculating travel-time
*            corrections at stations and for surface 
*            reflections (e.g., PnP, sS, P'P',...).
*  = 3       CRUST 1.0 is used to calculate travel times to 
*            stations with a maximum distance of 1.5 degrees 
*            from the source.
*  = 4       combines options (3) and (4).
*
CRUST 1.0     (0/1/2/3/4)          : 0

*
* If set, the applied local/regional model around the source 
* is listed at the end of the output file hyposat-out.
*
OUTPUT OF REGIONAL MODEL   (DEF 0) : 0

*
* Set VERY LOCAL GEOMETRY if all the stations are within an
* epicentral distance of less than about 50 km and a
* LOCAL OR REGIONAL MODEL is given.
*
* If VERY LOCAL GEOMETRY is set, the ray-tracing algorithm is
* adjusted for denser ray coverage to calculate the travel 
* times for the different local/regional phases and no 
* ellipticity corrections for the travel times are applied.
*
VERY LOCAL GEOMETRY    (DEF 0) 0/1 : 0

*
* The program can use different types of surface waves, for 
* which mean group velocities can be set as e.g.:
*
RG GROUP-VELOCITY  (DEF 2.5  km/s) : 2.5
LG GROUP-VELOCITY  (DEF 3.5  km/s) : 3.5

LQ GROUP-VELOCITY  (DEF 4.4  km/s) : 4.4

LR GROUP-VELOCITY  (DEF 3.95 km/s) : 3.95

*
* Infrasound onsets and T-phases can also be included. Onset 
* times of these phases are not well defined, but mean group 
* velocities can be used to identify such onsets. 
*

*
* Infrasound mean group velocity
*
IS PHASE GROUP-VEL (DEF 0.33 km/s) : 0.33

*
* T-phase mean group velocity
*
T PHASE GROUP-VEL   (DEF 1.4 km/s) : 1.45

*
* The model uncertainty can be defined as the mean uncertainty 
* of the travel-time table.
*
* The default value is no model uncertainty ('0').
*
INCLUDING MODEL UNCERTAINTY  (0/1) : 0

*
* The uncertainties can be given separately for P and S phases 
* in [s], but are assumed to be distance independent and equal 
* for all phases of the same type (P or S).
*
* The uncertainties will be used to calculate ray parameter 
* and distance dependent uncertainties for the different 
* observations, which will be added to the calculated standard 
* deviations of the source parameters after the last 
* iteration.
*
* The default values are set to 0.01 s for both P and S 
* phases.
*
MEAN P-WAVE MODEL UNCERTAINTY  [s] : 0.01
MEAN S-WAVE MODEL UNCERTAINTY  [s] : 0.01


**** STATION RELATED PARAMETERS

*
* Definition of the file containing the station coordinates. 
* Two formats are supported: CSS3.0 and PDE. The file format
* is detected automatically. To get the location results 
* faster, the usage of a file containing only the actually 
* used stations is recommended.
*
* The default file name is 'stations.dat'
*
STATION FILE                       : ./stations.dat

*
* Defines if station corrections (elevation, crust) will be 
* applied. By default, this is switched on '1'.
*
STATION CORRECTIONS    (DEF 1) 0/1 : 1

*
* Global velocities in [km/s] for elevation corrections can be 
* set here:
* All values below 0.001 and above 99. km/s are ignored and 
* the AK135 values are used as default.
*
* If S-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION is set to 0. and 
* P-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION is defined earlier, the 
* S-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION is calculated by 
* P-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION divided by sqrt(3.).
*
*P-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION    : 99.1            > AK135
*S-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION    : 99.1            > AK135
*P-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION    : 5.56              JB
*S-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION    : 3.37              JB
*
P-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION    : 5.80             AK135
S-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION    : 3.46             AK135

*
* Fixed station corrections or local velocities at stations 
* can be added in a file and will be used to correct for
* elevation or timing errors. Corrections are separate for P 
* and S waves. This value can also be used to correct for a
* known velocity anomaly below a station. The input is format 
* free. If such information is not available, leave it blank. 
* If a station is not in this list, the default values as 
* defined by the input parameters
* P-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION and
* S-VELOCITY TO CORRECT ELEVATION are used
*
* See file ../examples/stations.cor
*
STATION CORRECTION FILE            : _

*
* If the station corrections in the STATION CORRECTION FILE 
* file are only valid for the 1st onsets of the P or S phase 
* (as e.g., if calculated with velest), this switch must be 
* set to '1'.
*
* By default, the station corrections are used for all onsets 
* from the particular station.
*
STATION CORR ONLY 1ST PHASE  (0/1) : 0

*
* In the case of a very local geometry, stations may be
* located below the surface (e.g., in mines). Then one must
* set this switch to '1'.
* 
* The default value is '0'.
*
LOCAL STATION BELOW SURFACE  (0/1) : 0

*
* Maximun and minimum epicentral distance of stations to be
* considered during the inversion. Both distances are by 
* default in [deg]. But if the inversion output is set to [km] 
* with OUTPUT IN KM (see below), both MIN EPI DIST OF STAT and
* MAX EPI DIST OF STAT are also in [km].
*
MIN EPI DIST OF STAT (DEF   0 deg) : 0.
MAX EPI DIST OF STAT (DEF 180 deg) : 180.


**** SOURCE RELATED PARAMETERS

*
* The program has different ways to calculate a preliminary
* epicenter and source time. This can be steered with 
* different parameters. In any case, any value given directly 
* as initial value, will overwrite all estimated values.
*
* The following parameters are defining an initial solution 
* including its uncertainties:

*
* Source time:
*
* To set an initial source time the allowed formats are:
*    Epochal time (= seconds since 01/01/1970 00:00:00)
*    allowed is any number larger than -2840140800.0
*    (= default = 1 January 1880)
*
* or (seconds can be omitted):
*    yyyy-doy:hh.mi.ss.sss     (doy = Day of year)
* or
*    yyyy-mm-dd:hh.mi.ss.sss
*
* Any time earlier than the default value will be ignored. 
*
*STARTING SOURCE TIME               : 1970-001:00.00.00.000
* or
*STARTING SOURCE TIME               : 1970-01-01:00.00.00.000
* or 
STARTING SOURCE TIME (EPOCHAL TIME): 0.
STARTING TIME ERROR            [s] : 10.0 

*
* If no STARTING SOURCE TIME is set, an initial source time 
* will be estimated from the travel-time differences between 
* direct S-type and direct P-type observations by using 
* Wadati's approach (Wadati, 1933). For this, the program 
* calculates mean Vp/Vs ratios for each phase type and 
* estimates a source time, respectively. The phase types 
* (Pg & Sg, Pb & Sb, Pn & Sn, P & S) are identified with help 
* of the global model AK135. The initial source time is then 
* the mean value of all estimated source times. In the case of 
* only one S-P observation, the Vp/Vs ratio is set to 1.72 = 
* sqrt(3). If no S-P time observation is available, the source 
* time is set to the earliest observed onset time.

* The Wadati approach can be steered by the length of the 
* allowed S-type - P-type travel-time differences.
*
MIN DT FOR WADATI     (DEF   0. s) : 0.
MAX DT FOR WADATI     (DEF 150. s) : 150.

*
* Depth:
*

*
* Set source depth, the default depth is 0. +/- 20. km
*
STARTING SOURCE DEPTH         [km] : 0.
STARTING DEPTH ERROR          [km] : 20.

*
* The allowed depth range can be set. At this moment, the 
* program does not allow any sources with negative depth (= 
* models with topography above the sea level, see also 
* DEPTH ALLOWED ABOVE 0).
*
MINIMUM DEPTH          (DEF 0. km) : 0.
MAXIMUM DEPTH        (DEF 800. km) : 800.

*
* Flags steering the depth determination during inversion
*
*   f (or F)  = fixed depths at STARTING SOURCE DEPTH
*   d (or D)  = a new depth is determined from the beginning 
*               for each inversion step.
*   b (or B)  = both, the inversion starts with a fixed depth 
*               and when an epicenter is found, the inversion 
*               continues with inverting also for the depth.
* By default this flag is set to 'F'. 
*
DEPTH FLAG           (f,b,d,F,B,D) : F

*
* Epicenter:
*
* If backazimuth observations are available from several 
* stations, these data are used to calculate an epicenter by 
* calculating the possible crossing points of these different 
* observations. A start epicenter including its uncertainties 
* is then calculated as mean value of all crossing points and 
* their spread.
*
* If possible and no backazimuth observations are available, 
* the program tries a plane-wave fit through first P-wave 
* onsets at all stations to get an azimuth direction to the 
* epicenter. Then if possible, S - P travel-time differences 
* are used to estimate an epicentral distance and a start 
* epicenter is calculated.
*
* By default, this option is switched on '1'.
*
PLANE WAVE APPROX            (0/1) : 1

*
* Latitude:
*
* Allowed range -90 - +90 degrees; all other values are 
* ignored.
*
STARTING SOURCE LATITUDE     [deg] : 999.
STARTING LATITUDE ERROR      [deg] : 10.
*
* Longitude:
*
* Allowed range -180 - +180 degrees; all other values are 
* ignored.
*
STARTING SOURCE LONGITUDE    [deg] : 999.
STARTING LONGITUDE ERROR     [deg] : 20.

*
* The ISF solution (or only parts like epicenter and/or depth) 
* can be used as start (and reference) solution.
*
* By default, both flags are switched off '0'.
*
ISF EPICENTER                (0/1) : 0
ISF DEPTH                    (0/1) : 0


**** GENERAL INVERSION PROCESS STEERING PARAMETERS

*
* The maximum is set by default to 80 iterations
*
MAXIMUM # OF ITERATIONS            : 80 

*
* The iterations stop when two consecutive solutions are 
* separated less than the given accuracy in [km].
*
LOCATION ACCURACY      (DEF 1. km) : 0.5 

*
*  Confidence level of modelled uncertainties in [%] 
* probability. The default value is 68.3 % (i.e., +/- 1 
* standard deviation)
*
CONFIDENCE LEVEL  (68.3 - 99.99 %) : 95.

*
* In some cases, the inversion result is oscillating between 
* two or more solutions. The following parameter defines how 
* many iterations back we search for such oscillations. The 
* maximum number allowed is 15; the default value is 4.
*
# TO SEARCH OSCILLATIONS           : 4 

*
* In the case that the mean residuum of all defining travel 
* times is unequal 0., the source time can be corrected to 
* compensate for this mean shift.
*
* By default, this option is switched on '1'.
*
MEAN T-T RES. CORREC         (0/1) : 1

*
* The last iteration can constrain the solution by 
* concentrating on the most trustable/important data. Five 
* different cases are implemented:
*
*   0 = default, no final constraining
*   1 = final constraining of the solution by removing data 
*       with larger residuals
*   2 = final constraining by removing unimportant data as 
*       defined by the Information Density Matrix (see GMI 
*       theory)
*   3 = case 1 & 2
*   4 = case 1 with fixed max residuum (default 30 s)
*   5 = case 4 & 2
*
CONSTRAIN SOLUTION (0/1/2/3/4/5)   : 4

*
* Additional parameter needed for the cases 2, 3, 5 of
* CONSTRAIN SOLUTION:
*
* All data with Information Density matrix diagonal-element 
* entries smaller than this threshold are not used. The 
* threshold is calculated as ratio between actual Information 
* Density Matrix entry and the entry with the maximum value.
* The default is 0.005 = 0.5 % of the most important datum.
*
INF. DENSITY MATRIX THRESHOLD      : 0.005

*
* Additional parameters needed for the cases 4 and 5 of
* CONSTRAIN SOLUTION:
*
MAXIMUM ALLOWED P RESIDUUM (DEF 30): 30.

MAXIMUM ALLOWED S RESIDUUM (DEF 30): 30.
*
* The MAXIMUM AZIMUTH ERROR allowed value: 90. deg
MAXIMUM AZIMUTH ERROR     (DEF 45) : 45.

* The MAXIMUM SLOWNESS ERROR in [s/deg!] allowed value: 
* 15. s/deg.
MAXIMUM SLOWNESS ERROR    (DEF  5) : 5.

*
* The reading uncertainty of a seismic onset follows not a
* Gaussian distribution. HYPOSAT can use two different 
* standard deviations (STD) for the onset time to weight 
* travel-time data residuals, depending on the sign of the 
* residuum (always observation - calculation). The first STD 
* will then be used for positive and the second STD for 
* negative residuals. For more details see Schweitzer (2006).
*
*      0 = default, no 2nd STD
*      1 = reading of 2nd STD from input file (see the 
*          hyposat-in description)
*      2 = 2nd STD is STD * DBLE SID. ERROR FACTOR
*
DOUBLE SIDED TIME ERROR (0/1/2)    : 2
DBLE SID. ERROR FACTOR             : 0.5


**** STEERING THE USAGE OF OBSERVATIONS

* Onset time observations and phase names:

*
* If an event location should be only based on P-type onsets 
* one sets this here.
*
* By default, this is switched off '0'
*
P-TYPE ONSETS ONLY           (0/1) : 0

*
* The usage of phase names SG and LG is not always consistent.
* Following the IASPEI recommendations for seismic phase 
* names, HYPOSAT assumes LG to be a surface wave with a given 
* group velocity (see LG GROUP-VELOCITY).
*
* The following parameter settings can be used to homogenize 
* the input by automatically changing the phase names for all 
* SG or LG observations.
*
* By default, both options are switched off '0'.
* If both flags are set to '1', they will be both ignored.
*
LG-PHASE TO SG               (0/1) : 0
SG-PHASE TO LG               (0/1) : 0

*
* If one wants to use both the travel times of SG-type onsets 
* as body-waves and LG onsets as surface waves, it can make 
* sense to separate these two phases by the epicentral 
* distance.
*
* If the following distance in [km] has a value above zero, 
* this epicentral distance is used as separation between SG 
* and LG.
*
* Then, all LG are renamed to SG if the epicentral distance is
* shorter and all SG are renamed to LG if the epicentral 
* distance is equal or larger than this distance.
*
SG--LG DISTANCE     (DEF -999. km) : -999.

*
* By default, HYPOSAT uses travel-time differences between 
* different onsets at the same station as additional 
* constraint. This can be switched off '0'
*
FLAG USING TRAVEL-TIME DIFFERENCES : 1

* (Back)azimuth (BAZ) observations:

*
* The backazimuth (BAZ; azimuth from station to epicenter)
* information is by default used as defining observation. This 
* can be switched off by '0'.
*
AZIMUTH AS DEFINING          (0/1) : 1

*
* This switch must be set if one wants to use the BAZ 
* observations only for the estimation of an initial solution 
* (from crossing BAZ observations) and not for the further 
* inversions.
*
AZIMUTH ONLY INIT SOL  (DEF 0) 0/1 : 0

*
* If one has many BAZ observations and wants to get a location 
* based only on these observations (e.g., several infrasound 
* array observations).
*
AZIMUTH ONLY           (DEF 0) 0/1 : 0

*
* Defines the maximum allowed travel-time residual for which 
* the BAZ is used as defining observation for body waves and

*
* The default value is 30 s.
*
MAX T RES FOR AZI OF B USE     [s] : 30.

*
* Defines the maximum allowed travel-time residual for which 
* the BAZ is used as defining observation for long-period 
* surface waves.
*
* The default value is 180 s.
*
MAX T RES FOR AZI OF L USE     [s] : 180.

* Slowness observations:

*
* The slowness (ray parameter) of an observed onset is either
* defined by its inverse, the apparent velocity in [km/s] or 
* as spherical ray parameter in [s/deg]. The program handles 
* both, but in one input file (see hyposat-in), only one type 
* of units can be used.
*
* By default, and if the input file is in ISF format, the unit 
* is set to [s/deg].
*
SLOWNESS [S/DEG] (0 = APP. VEL)    : 1

*
* If the slowness observations should not be used as defining, 
* one must set this switch to '0'.
*
SLOWNESS AS DEFINING (DEF 1) 0/1   : 1

*
* Defines the maximum allowed travel-time residual for which 
* the slowness is used as defining observation for body waves. 
* The default value is set to 15 s.
*
MAX T RES FOR SLOWNESS USE         : 15.

*
* If the onset times of surface waves should be used as i
* defining observations, one must set this switch to '1'.
*
LP SURFACE WAVES (LQ/LR)  (DEF 0)  : 0

*
* When using ISF-formatted files as data input, no 
* uncertainties (standard deviations) of the observations are 
* given. These values must be set. 
*
* To define standard deviations of the observed parameters 
* based on the reported quality of the onset readings, see 
* the ISF/IMS documentation.
*
* For higher precision readings (input in milliseconds), the 
* values set here are reduced by 20%.
*
* For non-P-type onsets, the values given here are doubled.
*
* ISF_i and ISF_e are also used to define the quality of an 
* onset
* based on the applied uncertainty of the reading during the
* inversion process.
*

* Standard deviation for impulsive onset readings:
ISF_i                    (DEF .1 s) : 0.1

* Standard deviation for emergent onset readings:
ISF_e                    (DEF .5 s) : 0.5

* Standard deviation for other, non-defined onset readings:
ISF_o                    (DEF 1. s) : 1.

* Standard deviation for BAZ observations
ISF_az                (DEF 20. deg) : 20.

* Standard deviation for ray parameter observations
ISF_slo              (DEF 1. s/deg) : 1.


* Other input data:

*
* If infrasound observations (IS) shall be used as defining 
* this switch must be set to '1'.
*
IS-PHASE USAGE         (DEF 0) 0/1 : 0

*
* If the T-phase observations shall be used as defining 
* this switch must be set to '1'.
*
T-PHASE USAGE          (DEF 0) 0/1 : 0

* General input settings:

*
* If the following flag is set, all observations are used 
* during inversion according to the setting of TASDR (see 
* detailed description in hyposat-in), independently of the 
* size of the residual(s).
* By default, this option is switched off '0'.
* 
FLAG USING INPUT FIXED       (0/1) : 0

*
* The program can check the input for more than one onset of 
* the same phase at one station and reduce these onsets to one 
* entry. This option is of particular interest whenever onset 
* readings from several sources are merged together to one 
* single input file. The reduction (after removing double 
* entries) is done by calculating mean onset parameters and 
* adding the spread of the different onset parameters (time, 
* BAZ and slowness) to the reading uncertainty of this 
* observation.
*
* Amplitude/period readings will not be changed.
*
* By default, this option is switched off '0'.
*
FLAG CHECKING MULTIPLE ONSETS (0/1): 0

*
* The maximum time difference between two observations to be 
* merged into one new observation in [s].
*

**** I/O RELATED PARAMETERS
*

*
* Input:
*

* The default data-input file name is hyposat-in.
* Here another file name for the data-input file can be given.
* The default is also used when set to '_' or ' '.
*
INPUT FILE NAME                    : hyposat-in

*
* The hyposat-in format has slightly changed with the new 
* HYPOSAT 6. If the input file still follows the old syntax, 
* one has to set this flag. The default is '0' for using the 
* new syntax.
*
HYPOSAT-IN OLD SYNTAX  (DEF 0) 0/1 : 0

*
* Besides data input in HYPOSAT format, HYPOSAT can also read 
* ISF (IMS) Bulletin formatted files as data input. The 
* input-file name can be either hyposat-in or any other name 
* as set with INPUT FILE NAME.
*
* By default, the input is in HYPOSAT format.
*
INPUT FORMAT ISF       (DEF 0) 0/1 : 0

*
* Output:
*

*
* Program output is written by default in the file 
* hyposat-out, which is also used when input is '_' or ' '. 
* This name can be changed. 
*
OUTPUT FILE NAME                   : hyposat-out

*
* With this flag any output to a file can be switched off. By
* default set to '1' and the output is written in the file 
* defined by OUTPUT FILE NAME.
*
OUTPUT SWITCH          (DEF 1) 0/1 : 1

*
* The epicentral distance of the observations can be 
* calculated in [km] or [degree].
* See also MAX EPI DIST OF STAT and MIN EPI DIST OF STAT.
*
* If setting the flag OUTPUT IN KM, no ISF-formatted file can 
* be written (OUTPUT FORMAT ISF is then automatically set to 
* '0').
*
* The default output is epicentral distances in degrees '0'.
*
OUTPUT IN KM                 (0/1) : 0

*
* The program can calculate theoretical BAZ and slowness 
* values for all observations and write these values in the 
* hyposat-out file. 
*
* If theoretical values are added to the output file, no 
* residuals are calculated and these fields stay empty.
*
* These values are ignored in ISF formatted output.
*
*       0 = default, no output of theoretical values
*       1 = theoretical BAZ are given in output
*       2 = theoretical slowness values are given in output
*       3 = both (BAZ & slowness values) are given in output
*
OUTPUT OF THEO. BAZ+P    (0/1/2/3) : 0

*
* The program can calculate an epicentral error ellipse based 
* on the chosen CONFIDENCE LEVEL and the estimated hypocenter 
* or epicenter uncertainties.
*
* By default, this option is switched on '1'.
*
EPICENTER ERROR ELLIPSE      (0/1) : 1

*
* The primary and secondary azimuthal gaps can be calculated 
* for
*           = 0 all defining observations (default)
*           = 1 all observing stations
*
* In any case, observations are considered only from stations 
* in the allowed distance range (see MAX EPI DIST OF STAT and
* MIN EPI DIST OF STAT)
*
AZIMUTHAL GAP FOR OBSERVATIONS     : 0

*
* HYPOSAT can also calculate for all identified body-wave 
* onsets the corresponding emergence angles at the seismic 
* source.
* This flag is by default switched off.
*
FLAG EMERGENCE ANGLE OUTPUT (DEF 0): 0

*
* HYPOSAT calculates two types of RMS values: one is the 
* traditional RMS of all residuals from defining travel-time 
* observations and the other is the RMS calculated from the 
* weighted residuals as done at the ISC. Both values are 
* listed in the hyposat-out file.
*
* In the case of an additional ISF-formatted output file (see
* OUTPUT FORMAT ISF), the origin line contains only one place 
* to write an RMS value. 
* By default, the traditional RMS value is used. If the 
* following switch is set, the ISC-type RMS value is written.
* 
ISC-TYPE ISF RMS             (0/1) : 0

*
* The final HYPOSAT solution can be compared with a reference
* location, which can be set with the following parameters
* 
* The default is that no reference location is used '0'.
*
REFERENCE EVENT              (0/1) : 0
REFERENCE SOURCE LONGITUDE   [deg] : -999.
REFERENCE SOURCE LATITUDE    [deg] : -999.
REFERENCE SOURCE DEPTH        [km] : -999.

*
* In ISF-formatted files, the listed origins are identified 
* with an author (source). Different authors are allowed but 
* usually one location is identified as primary location.
*
* Here the author of the preferred reference location can be 
* set. This location will then be used as reference location 
* and as starting solution for the inversion process.
*
* If one wants to use the primary location, independently from 
* the author, one has to give 'PRIME'.
*
* If the parameter is set to '_', just the first origin in the 
* input file is used.
*
* e.g.:
*ISF REFERENCE LOCATION             : NOA
*ISF REFERENCE LOCATION             : PRIME
*ISF REFERENCE LOCATION             : ISC
*
ISF REFERENCE LOCATION             : _

*
* HYPOSAT can additionally write the location results in an
* ISF-formatted file. The file name is either hyposat-isf or 
* any other name defined by OUTPUT FILE NAME with the 
* additional extension _isf.
*
* By default ('0'), no ISF-formatted output is written.
*
OUTPUT FORMAT ISF      (DEF 0) 0/1 : 0

*
* In ISF-formatted files, Event and Origin Identifications 
* (Ids) can be defined.
*
* Event Id:
* Any integer is allowed between 0 and 999999999. By default, 
* it will be set to 0 (but then the number from an eventually 
* used ISF-formatted input file is used).
*
ISF EVENT ID                       : 0

*
* An ISF-formatted file can contain several event locations
* for the same event. The different locations can be 
* separated by Origin Ids. The Origin Id can be any 8-
* character long string. 
* By default ('_') HYPOSAT uses, if it exists, the Id from the
* ISF-formated input file.
*
ISF ORIGIN ID                      : _

*
* Based on the location results and after eventually renaming 
* and/or merging onsets, the program can write a new file in 
* input format. The file name will be hyposat-in.rev or the 
* file name defined by OUTPUT FILE NAME with the extension 
* _rev
*
* By default, this option is switched off.
*
FLAG NEW INPUT FILE          (0/1) : 0

*
* HYPOSAT has different verbosity levels for output on the 
* screen during program execution. This level can be defined 
* here.
*
* If OUTPUT LEVEL > 10, the output level for the screen is 
* internally calculated and an extra output file 
* hyposat_gmi.out is written with additional information about 
* the Generalized Matrix Inversion (GMI) results. Then, the 
* resolution, covariance, correlation, and the information-
* density matrix will be written out. A definition of the 
* matrices can be found e.g., in the text books of 
* Menke (1989) or Aki & Richards (1980). The file
* hyposat_gmi.out always contains the named matrices for the 
* last inversion. OUTPUT LEVEL can be set to the following 
* values:
* 
* OUTPUT LEVEL  Matrix Output           Output Level on Screen
* 0 - 10        None                               0 - 10
