c
c     Short desciption - for more details see HYPOSAT-Manual and
c     HYPOSAT papers in NORSAR Sci. Rep., PAGEOPH and PEPI. 
c
c
c     This program locates seismic events by inverting 
c     observed travel times, backazimuths, and slowness values.
c
c     Different phases observed at one station can be used to 
c     calculate travel-time differences. These differences are 
c     then used to invert for the hypocenter.
c
c     A preliminary epicenter will be defined with the backazimuth 
c     observations, or with other available information.
c
c     If possible a source time will be estimated by a 
c     Wadati-Approach from the S-P travel-time difference(s) assuming 
c     a constant v(p)/v(s)=sqrt(3.) for each phase type separately.
c
c     The final location is done with a Single-Value-Decomposition
c     algorithm, which results in a least squares fit for
c     all four source parameters using travel-time models from
c     tau-spline-type tables (i.e., IASP91, AK135, PREM, ...), 
c     and / or a local/regional model of horizontal layers.
c
c     All travel times are corrected  for the ellipticity of the
c     Earth.
c
c     All available information is used including standard 
c     deviations for observed data and 'a priori' information
c     for the model parameter.
c
c     All calculations are done for the Earth as a sphere and
c     travel times are corrected  for the ellipticity of the
c     Earth.

c                               solutions changed, especially for depth
c                               determinations.
c                               Correcting to-time for Wadati formula;

c                               program choose the right name depending
c                               on travel-time table and distance.

c                               station, if no backazimuth information

c
c                               Because no ellipticity corrections are 
c                               available for events deeper than 700 km,
c                               we accept a smal error for events 
c                               between 700 km and 800 km.
